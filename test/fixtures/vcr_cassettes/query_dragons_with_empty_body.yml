        2 (also Crew Dragon, Dragon V2, or formerly DragonRider) is the second version
        of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will be a human-rated vehicle. It includes
        a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two SuperDraco engines each,
        which can serve as a launch escape system or launch abort system (LAS). In
        addition, it has much larger windows, new flight computers and avionics, and
        redesigned solar arrays, and a modified outer mold line from the initial cargo
        Dragon that has been flying for several years.","id":"5e9d058859b1ffd8e2ad5f90"}],"totalDocs":2,"offset":0,"limit":10,"totalPages":1,"page":1,"pagingCounter":1,"hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false,"prevPage":null,"nextPage":null}'
