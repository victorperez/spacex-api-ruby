        historic pad that launched most of the Saturn V and Space Shuttle missions,
        including Apollo 11. SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew
        Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following
        the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary
        modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in
        February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon
        Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure.
        More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed
        in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches
        other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending
        on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future
        for use with the BFR.","status":"active","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"}],"totalDocs":6,"offset":0,"limit":10,"totalPages":1,"page":1,"pagingCounter":1,"hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false,"prevPage":null,"nextPage":null}'
